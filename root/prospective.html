			<p>Feel free to review this <a href="/static/pdf/sample_lease.pdf">sample lease</a> (PDF). A lease is a legally binding contract, so prospective tenants should review it completely before providing their signature. We're pretty easy going and we're willing to work with you on the details, but any amendments must be made before the contract is signed. Know that once the lease is signed we will readily enforce it.</p>
